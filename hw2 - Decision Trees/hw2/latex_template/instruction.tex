     \item $\circle$ Marie Curie

If you need to change your answer, you may cross out the previous answer and bubble in the new answer:

\end{quote}


For ``Select all that apply" questions, please fill in all appropriate squares completely:

    \begin{list}{}
    \item $\blacksquare$ Stephen Hawking 
    \item $\blacksquare$ Albert Einstein
    \item $\blacksquare$ Isaac Newton
    \item $\square$ I don't know
\end{list}
\end{quote}

Again, if you need to change your answer, you may cross out the previous answer(s) and bubble in the new answer(s):

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Select all that apply:} Which are scientists?
    \begin{list}{}
    \item $\blacksquare$ Stephen Hawking 
    \item $\blacksquare$ Albert Einstein

    \xcancel{$\blacksquare$} I don't know
\end{list}
\end{quote}

For questions where you must fill in a blank, please make sure your final answer is fully included in the given space. You may cross out answers or parts of answers, but the final answer must still be within the given space.

\begin{quote}
